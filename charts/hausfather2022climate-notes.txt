> The sixth and latest IPCC assessment weights climate models according to how well they reproduce other evidence

More than 50 such models were assessed and compared in the latest round of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project, phase 6 (CMIP6), run by the World Climate Research Programme [1]

a subset of the newest generation of models are ‘too hot’[2] and project climate warming in response to carbon dioxide emissions that might be larger than that supported by other evidence [3–7]
CMIP6 models include more sophisticated treatments of ice, water and clouds than earlier ones
(IPCC), to its credit, has recognized this ‘hot model’ problem

Sixth Assessment Report (AR6
applied statistics to determine the most reasonable projections, consistent with many lines of evidence, which they call ‘assessed warming’.
Unfortunately, little guidance was made available for scientists wishing to study projections in other contexts
Studies that cover monthly or daily extremes or regional climate impacts, for example, are instead left to use the full set of CMIP6 models.

## Hot tail

> The largest source of uncertainty in global temperatures 50 or 100 years from now is the volume of future greenhouse-gas emissions, which are largely under human control.

- __transient climate response (TCR)__, or the amount of global warming in the year in which atmospheric CO2 concentrations have finally doubled after having steadily increased by 1% every year. 
- __equilibrium climate sensitivity (ECS)__, the eventual long-term temperature response to CO2 concentrations that have doubled and remain doubled.


In previous generations of climate models in __CMIP5, no model had an ECS of higher than 4.7 °C__. In __CMIP6, more than one-quarter of models have sensitivities that are greater__ than this, and __around one-fifth show warming of at least 5 °C__ in response to a doubling of atmospheric CO2 concentrations, according to our analysis. Numerous studies have found that __these high-sensitivity models do a poor job of reproducing historical temperatures__ over time [4–7] and in simulating the climates of the distant past [8]. Specifically, they often show no warming over the twentieth century and then a sharp warming spike in the past few decades 3, and some simulate the last ice age as being much colder than palaeoclimate evidence indicates [7].

### 2020 community review (that four of us co-authored) [8] concluded 
- that the __ECS is likely (with a 66% chance) to be in the range of 2.6–3.9 °C__, 
- and __very likely (with a 90% chance) to lie between 2.3 and 4.7 °C__.

### On the basis of that review and other recent findings, the AR6 authors decided 
- to narrow the climate sensitivity they considered __‘likely’__ to a similar range, of __between 2.5 and 4 °C__, 
- and to a __‘very likely’__ range of between __2 °C and 5 °C__.

## Beyond model democracy

__AR6__ report used various published statistical weighting methods [4–6]
giving more weight to those that agreed with historical temperature observations

## What to do

__treating each model the same__
leads to exaggerated projections: global average surface temperatures in 2100 that are __0.2–0.7 °C warmer__ than those with AR6 assessed warming

Paris agreement targets of 1.5 °C and ‘well below 2 °C

IPCC Working Group I Interactive Atlas is a good tool for calculating multi-model means https://interactive-atlas.ipcc.ch

1. __In situations for which policymakers require information on timing, we suggest using AR6 assessed warming__ to map projections for global warming levels onto emissions scenarios, ensuring consistency between regional studies and AR6.
2. Second, __if the warming trajectory — rather than just the global warming level — is important__ for a particular climate outcome, __focus on the subset of CMIP6 models__ that is most consistent with AR6 assessed-warming projections __We recommend screening out models with a TCR that lies outside the ‘likely’ (66% likelihood range) of 1.4–2.2 °C__. The AR6 assessed-warming constraints are correlated with the TCR, so this gives a good approximation to the assessed warming[4]. This approach allows for an assessment of regional changes over time. Alternatively, using a _‘likely’ 2.5–4 °C ECS screen also reproduces AR6 results well_, although _at the expense of discarding 60% of the models_ in the CMIP6 ensemble, compared with 40% in the TCR screened subset.
3. Third, pick models that are best suited to the task at hand. The problem is not that high sensitivity models exist, but rather that the preponderance of them in the CMIP6 ensemble biases the mean and uncertainty range upwards.
If there is a real need to examine ‘hot tail’ risks — because there is still a __more than 5% chance of ECS exceeding 5 °C__ (ref. [8]) — use a high-sensitivity subset. Ask whether changes in average conditions or extreme events in the region of interest scale with the global mean temperature. In cases in which model spread is not clearly related to the spread in climate sensi-tivity, alternative metrics might be appropriate.
